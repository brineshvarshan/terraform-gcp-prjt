Absolutely, buddy 😎
Here’s a **clean and professional README** template you can directly add to your repo — perfectly written for your current **Terraform + GCP project setup**.

## 🧱 Terraform GCP Infrastructure Demo

### 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Terraform** to provision and manage infrastructure in **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
It includes setup for Terraform configuration files, provider configuration, variable management, and best practices using `.gitignore` for security.

---

### 🎯 Project Objectives

* Learn how to **write Terraform code** for GCP.
* Understand the role of **main.tf**, **variables.tf**, and **provider.tf**.
* Practice secure handling of **GCP Service Account Keys**.
* Apply **Terraform workflow** — `init`, `plan`, `apply`, and `destroy`.

### ⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   cd terraform
2. **Add your GCP Service Account key**
   * Place your key file inside the `infra/` folder.
   * Update the path inside `provider.tf` if needed.
   * The key file is **ignored** by Git for security.
3. **Initialize Terraform**
   terraform init
4. **Validate and Plan**
   terraform validate
   terraform plan
5. **Apply the Configuration**
   terraform apply
6. **Destroy Resources (Clean Up)**
   terraform destroy
---
### 🔐 Security Notes
* Never upload your **GCP service account key** or `.tfstate` files to GitHub.
* `.gitignore` has been configured to automatically exclude all sensitive data.
* Follow **least privilege** while creating the GCP service account key.
---
### 🧠 Learning Outcome
By completing this project, you’ll gain:
* Hands-on experience in Terraform configuration.
* Understanding of infrastructure automation in GCP.
* Knowledge of security and version control best practices in IaC projects.
